# ✍️ Displaying a Frame of KITTI

## Displaying the Point Cloud of the First Frame

Display the first frame's point cloud using `bevy_pointcloud`

Tips:

- The frame is available at `kitti-2011_09_26_drive_0005_sync/velodyne/0000000000.laz`
- To start, a top down camera is a good idea, with a position at `(-1.0, 100.0, 0.0)` looking at the origin.
