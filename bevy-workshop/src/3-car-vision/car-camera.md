# Car Camera

## Display the Car Camera View

With the recording, we also have color photos of the car view. We can use these photos to help understand the point cloud. Let's add a new camera to the window, this time displaying the photos.

Tips:

- Restrict the first person view of the point cloud to a quarter of the window
- Add a 2D camera to the remaining quarter
- Display the png with the same name as the currently displayed point cloud
