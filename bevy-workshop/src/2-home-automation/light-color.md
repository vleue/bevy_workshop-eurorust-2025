# ✍️ Light Color

## Change the light color

Let's get fancy, with colored lights!

The goal if this exercise is to play with Bevy Feathers widgets, so we'll ignore the remote server part for now.

Add to the light panel a widget to change the light color.

Tips:

- Look at <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/release-0.17.2/examples/ui/feathers.rs> for inspiration
- Color of a `PointLight` is defined by its [`color` field](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.17.2/bevy/light/struct.PointLight.html#structfield.color)
