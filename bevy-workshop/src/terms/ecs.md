# ECS

## E for Entity

An Entity is a unique identifier that represents a general-purpose object in the ECS. It acts as a pointer.

## C for Component

A Component is a data structure that holds information or attributes of an entity. Components are used to store the state and data of entities.

## S for System

A System is a function that operates on entities with specific components. Systems define the behavior and logic of the ECS by processing entities' components.

## Another way to think about ECS

It's a database!

Entities are the index, components are the columns and systems are procedural queries.
