Building interactive data visualizations in Rust can be a daunting task... Let's see how Bevy, a data-driven game engine, can help us! From building interactive dashboard to spatial and temporal data visualization, or just Computer Assisted Design, Bevy can be the solid (and fun!) foundation of your next application. This workshop will teach you Bevy basics through non game applications, and a few advanced rendering techniques, so that you're ready to tackle those challenges!

By the end of this workshop, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how Bevy works and will have tried a few usages outside of games.

## Target Audience

This workshop is designed for individuals who want to deepen their understanding of Bevy basics and already have a good grasp of Rust.

To get started with Rust, explore these free resources:
